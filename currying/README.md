Currying

In mathematics and computer science, currying is the technique of translating the evaluation of a function that takes multiple arguments (or a tuple of arguments) into evaluating a sequence of functions, each with a single argument (partial application). It was introduced by Moses Schönfinkel[1][2][3] and later developed by Haskell Curry.[4][5]

Uncurrying is the dual transformation to currying, and can be seen as a form of defunctionalization. It takes a function f(x) which returns another function g(y) as a result, and yields a new function f′(x,y) which takes a number of additional parameters and applies them to the function returned by function f. The process can be iterated if necessary.**
